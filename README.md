# INIAD MOOCs Language Switcher
This is a Chrome Extension that allows for easy language switching in the MOOCS learning system used in Toyo University INIAD without having to change the language setting by digging deep into the user settings every time.
## Getting Started
### Installation
Load the unpacked extension into Chrome Beta/Canary build with developer mode turned on.
### Usage
Simply click the `Switch Language` button on the top right of the page under your name. Since this extension is designed for English language users in mind, the first switch will always default to Japanese. If your default language is set to Japanese, you will need to click the button twice in order to switch to English.
## Afternote
### To-Do
 - Japanese README
 - Default language setting checker
 - Packed extension for easy installation via Chrome Web Store
